# MedTranslate AI Patient App Assets

This directory contains image assets for the MedTranslate AI Patient App.

## Required Images

The following images need to be added by a designer:

- `logo.png`: App logo
- `welcome-1.png`: Welcome screen image 1
- `welcome-2.png`: Welcome screen image 2
- `welcome-3.png`: Welcome screen image 3
- `welcome-4.png`: Welcome screen image 4

## Testing Notes

For testing purposes, we can modify the code to use placeholder images or text instead of these assets. This allows us to test the functionality of the app without waiting for the final design assets.

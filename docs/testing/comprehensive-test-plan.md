## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of this test plan are to:

1. Verify that the MedTranslate AI application functions correctly across all components
2. Ensure that the edge device integration works as expected, including offline functionality
3. Validate that the application meets security requirements and best practices
4. Confirm that the application is properly localized for all supported languages

## Testing Scope

This test plan covers the following components of the MedTranslate AI project:

- Backend API services
- Edge application
- Provider application
- Patient application
- Admin dashboard
- Mobile applications (iOS and Android)

## Testing Approach

The testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Automated Testing**: Wherever possible, tests are automated to ensure consistency and repeatability
2. **Real Device Testing**: Testing on real devices is prioritized over simulators/emulators
3. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are integrated into the development workflow
4. **Risk-Based Testing**: Higher-risk areas receive more thorough testing
5. **User-Centered Testing**: Testing focuses on user scenarios and workflows

## Test Environment

Testing will be conducted in the following environments:

1. **Development Environment**: For unit tests and initial integration tests
2. **Staging Environment**: For comprehensive integration testing
3. **Production-Like Environment**: For final validation before release
4. **Real Devices**: For edge device testing and mobile app testing

## Testing Tools

The following tools are used for testing:

1. **Test Runner**: Custom Node.js test runner (`tests/run-all-tests.js`)
2. **Edge Device Testing**: Custom test suite (`tests/integration/edge-device-integration.test.js`)
3. **Security Testing**: Security audit tool (`tests/security/security-audit-tool.js`)
4. **Localization Testing**: Localization test tool (`tests/localization/localization-test.js`)
5. **App Store Submission**: App store submission tool (`tests/app-store/app-store-submission-tool.js`)
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: UAT screens in the application

## Test Categories

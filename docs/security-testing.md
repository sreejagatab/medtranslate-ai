- **Device Authentication**: Tests that edge devices authenticate securely
- **Data Protection**: Verifies that data on edge devices is protected
- **Tamper Detection**: Tests for tamper detection mechanisms
- **Secure Communication**: Verifies that communications are secure
- **Resource Isolation**: Tests that resources are properly isolated

### Implementation:
Edge Device Security Testing is implemented using Jest test suites that perform various security tests on edge devices.

### Usage:
To run the Edge Device Security Tests:
```bash
npm run test:security:edge
```

## Compliance Testing

Compliance Testing ensures that the MedTranslate AI system complies with relevant regulations.

### Tests:
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Verifies compliance with HIPAA regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Tests compliance with GDPR regulations
- **CCPA Compliance**: Verifies compliance with CCPA regulations
- **HITECH Compliance**: Tests compliance with HITECH regulations
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Verifies compliance with PCI DSS regulations
- **SOC 2 Compliance**: Tests compliance with SOC 2 requirements
- **ISO 27001 Compliance**: Verifies compliance with ISO 27001 standards
- **NIST Compliance**: Tests compliance with NIST guidelines

### Implementation:
Compliance Testing is implemented using a combination of automated tests and manual verification procedures.

### Usage:
To run the Compliance Tests:
```bash
npm run test:compliance
```

## Penetration Testing

Penetration Testing identifies vulnerabilities by simulating attacks on the MedTranslate AI system.

### Tests:
- **Authentication Bypass**: Attempts to bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization Bypass**: Attempts to bypass authorization controls
- **Injection Attacks**: Tests for SQL, NoSQL, and command injection vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Tests for XSS vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Tests for CSRF vulnerabilities
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Tests for SSRF vulnerabilities
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Tests for IDOR vulnerabilities
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Identifies security misconfigurations

### Implementation:
Penetration Testing is performed by security professionals using various tools and techniques.

### Usage:
Penetration Testing should be performed by qualified security professionals.

## Security Testing Reports

Security Testing generates detailed reports that provide information about security issues found in the system.

### Report Contents:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of security issues
- **Vulnerability Details**: Detailed information about each vulnerability
- **Risk Assessment**: Assessment of the risk posed by each vulnerability
- **Remediation Recommendations**: Recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Status**: Status of compliance with relevant regulations
- **Test Coverage**: Information about the coverage of security tests

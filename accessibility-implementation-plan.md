# MedTranslate AI: Accessibility Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for implementing accessibility features across the MedTranslate AI application to ensure it's usable by people with disabilities.

## Accessibility Standards

The application will conform to the following standards:
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance
- **Section 508** requirements for healthcare applications
- **iOS and Android** platform-specific accessibility guidelines

## Accessibility Audit

### Current Status
- Basic screen reader support
- Limited keyboard navigation
- Inconsistent focus management
- Some color contrast issues
- Limited alternative text for images
- No accessibility documentation

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Screen Reader Compatibility

#### Provider Dashboard
- [ ] Add proper ARIA roles to all components
- [ ] Implement accessible labels for all interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management in modals
- [ ] Add descriptive announcements for dynamic content changes
- [ ] Implement accessible table structures for session lists

#### Patient Application
- [ ] Enhance VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- [ ] Add descriptive labels for language selection
- [ ] Implement accessible instructions for voice recording
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management during navigation
- [ ] Add descriptive announcements for translation status changes

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### Provider Dashboard
- [ ] Implement logical tab order
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Implement focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add skip links for navigation

#### Patient Application
- [ ] Ensure all touch targets are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Implement focus management for modal dialogs
- [ ] Add keyboard alternatives for gesture-based interactions
- [ ] Implement focus trapping for modals
- [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation in lists

### 3. Visual Accessibility

#### Color and Contrast
- [ ] Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Add high contrast mode
- [ ] Ensure color is not the only means of conveying information
- [ ] Implement accessible focus indicators
- [ ] Test with color blindness simulators

#### Text and Typography
- [ ] Support dynamic text sizing
- [ ] Ensure minimum text size of 16px
- [ ] Implement proper text spacing
- [ ] Use readable font families
- [ ] Support system font size settings

### 4. Motor Accessibility

#### Touch Targets
- [ ] Ensure minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels
- [ ] Add sufficient spacing between interactive elements
- [ ] Implement forgiving touch areas
- [ ] Reduce precision required for interactions
- [ ] Add alternative input methods

#### Gestures and Interactions
- [ ] Provide alternatives to complex gestures
- [ ] Implement adjustable timing for interactions
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for interactions
- [ ] Support external switch devices
- [ ] Implement voice control alternatives

### 5. Cognitive Accessibility

#### User Interface
- [ ] Use clear, simple language
- [ ] Implement consistent navigation patterns
- [ ] Add visual cues for important information
- [ ] Reduce cognitive load with progressive disclosure
- [ ] Provide clear error messages and recovery options

#### Content
- [ ] Add illustrations to support text
- [ ] Implement step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Use plain language for medical terms
- [ ] Add tooltips for complex concepts
- [ ] Provide multiple ways to access information

### 6. Hearing Accessibility

#### Audio Alternatives
- [ ] Add visual indicators for audio feedback
- [ ] Implement captions for audio content
- [ ] Provide text alternatives for voice interactions
- [ ] Support adjustable volume levels
- [ ] Add visual patterns for audio patterns

#### Notifications
- [ ] Implement visual notifications
- [ ] Add haptic feedback alternatives
- [ ] Support system notification settings
- [ ] Ensure notifications are perceivable through multiple senses
- [ ] Allow customization of notification types

## Component-Specific Implementations

### EnhancedLanguageSelector
- [ ] Add proper ARIA roles and labels
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for language selection
- [ ] Ensure screen reader announces selected language
- [ ] Add focus management for modal dialog
- [ ] Implement accessible search functionality

### EnhancedVoiceRecordButton
- [ ] Add alternative text input method
- [ ] Ensure haptic feedback is configurable
- [ ] Implement accessible status announcements
- [ ] Add keyboard alternative for recording
- [ ] Ensure visual feedback is perceivable without color

### SessionManagementPanel
- [ ] Implement accessible table structure
- [ ] Add proper ARIA roles for interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management for modals
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements for state changes

### TranslationMonitorPanel
- [ ] Add text alternatives for charts
- [ ] Implement keyboard accessible controls
- [ ] Ensure color is not the only means of conveying confidence levels
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements for translation updates
- [ ] Implement accessible error reporting

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Implement accessibility linting in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated tests for ARIA attributes
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation with automated tools
- [ ] Validate color contrast automatically
- [ ] Check HTML semantics with automated tools

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, TalkBack)
- [ ] Perform keyboard-only navigation testing
- [ ] Test with various assistive technologies
- [ ] Conduct user testing with people with disabilities
- [ ] Validate against WCAG 2.1 AA checklist

## Documentation and Training

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create accessibility guide for users
- [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add instructions for screen reader users
- [ ] Document assistive technology compatibility
- [ ] Create tutorials for accessibility features

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Document accessibility requirements
- [ ] Create component-specific accessibility guidelines

# Enhanced Predictive Caching System for MedTranslate AI

This document provides an overview of the enhanced predictive caching system implemented for the MedTranslate AI Edge Application.

## Overview

The enhanced predictive caching system is designed to provide robust offline capabilities for the MedTranslate AI Edge Application. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict which translations will be needed in the future, especially during offline periods, and proactively caches them.

## Key Features

### Network Quality Monitoring

- **Real-time Network Quality Assessment**: Continuously monitors network quality using multiple metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth, DNS resolution time)
- **Network Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical network patterns to predict offline periods
- **Adaptive Monitoring**: Adjusts monitoring frequency based on network quality and device conditions

### Intelligent Predictive Caching

- **Multi-level Prioritization**: Categorizes predictions into critical, high, medium, and low priority levels
- **Context-aware Predictions**: Uses medical context, language pairs, and usage patterns to make predictions
- **Offline Risk Assessment**: Calculates offline risk based on historical patterns and current conditions
- **Advanced ML Models**: Utilizes sophisticated machine learning models for more accurate predictions
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines multiple prediction approaches for better results

### Energy-aware Optimization

- **Battery-aware Caching**: Adjusts caching aggressiveness based on battery level and charging status
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks device performance metrics to optimize resource usage
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatically adjusts thresholds based on device conditions

### Storage Management

- **Quota Management**: Enforces storage quotas to prevent excessive disk usage
- **Compression**: Uses compression to reduce storage requirements
- **Intelligent Cleanup**: Prioritizes content removal based on importance and usage patterns

## Components

### Network Monitor (`network-monitor.js`)

The network monitor provides real-time monitoring of network connectivity and quality. It includes:

- Network quality assessment (latency, packet loss, bandwidth)
- Offline period prediction
- Historical network pattern analysis
- Adaptive monitoring intervals

### Predictive Cache (`predictive-cache.js`)

The predictive cache is the core component that predicts which translations will be needed and manages the cache. It includes:

- Usage pattern analysis
- Prediction model generation
- Offline preparation strategies
- Energy-aware caching

### ML Models (`ml-models/`)

The ML models directory contains advanced machine learning models for more accurate predictions:

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts usage patterns based on time (Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Method, Holt-Winters)
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends content based on feature similarity
- **Network Pattern Analysis**: Predicts offline periods based on network patterns
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines multiple models for better predictions

### Storage Manager (`utils/storage-manager.js`)

The storage manager handles all storage-related operations, including:

- Quota management
- Compression
- Storage optimization
- Persistence

## Usage

### Initializing the System

```javascript
const predictiveCache = require('./predictive-cache');

// Initialize the predictive cache
await predictiveCache.initialize();
```

### Preparing for Offline Mode

```javascript
// Standard preparation
const result = await predictiveCache.prepareForOfflineMode();

// Energy-aware preparation (for low battery situations)
const energyAwareResult = await predictiveCache.prepareForOfflineMode({
  energyAware: true
});

// High-risk preparation (when offline is highly likely)
const highRiskResult = await predictiveCache.prepareForOfflineMode({
  offlineRisk: 0.9,
  forcePrepare: true
});
```

### Getting Predictions

```javascript
// Get predictions with default settings
const predictions = predictiveCache.getPredictions();

// Get predictions with custom settings
const customPredictions = predictiveCache.getPredictions({
  count: 20,
  offlineRiskOnly: true,
  aggressiveness: 0.8
});
```

### Using ML Models

```javascript
// Get ML model adapter
const modelAdapter = require('./ml-models/model-adapter');

// Initialize ML models
await modelAdapter.initialize();

// Train ML models with usage data
const usageStats = predictiveCache.getUsageStats();
await modelAdapter.trainModels(usageStats);

// Generate ML-based predictions
const mlPredictions = modelAdapter.generatePredictions({
  currentHour: new Date().getHours(),
  currentDay: new Date().getDay(),
  languagePair: 'en-es',
  context: 'general',
  confidenceThreshold: 0.2,
  maxPredictions: 20,
  includeOfflineRisk: true
});

// Predict offline risk
const offlineRisk = modelAdapter.predictOfflineRisk();
console.log(`Current offline risk: ${(offlineRisk * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

### Generating Sample Texts

```javascript
// Generate a single sample text for a prediction
const sampleText = predictiveCache.generateSampleText(prediction);

// Generate multiple sample texts with variations
const multipleSamples = predictiveCache.generateMultipleSampleTexts(prediction, 3);
```

## Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test suite that can be run using:

```
node run-predictive-cache-test.js
```

The test suite includes:

- Network quality assessment testing
- Offline preparation testing
- Prediction generation testing
- Sample data generation for realistic testing
- ML model unit testing
- ML integration testing
- Performance benchmarking

For ML-specific tests, run:

```

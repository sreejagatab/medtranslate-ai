# MedTranslate AI - Enhanced Offline Mode with Predictive Caching

This module provides advanced predictive caching capabilities to enhance the offline mode of the MedTranslate AI Edge Application. It uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze usage patterns, predict future needs, and pre-cache content to ensure optimal performance even when offline.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Prediction Model

The enhanced prediction model now includes:

- **Time-based patterns**: Analyzes usage by time of day and day of week
- **User session analysis**: Identifies common sequences and transitions
- **Network pattern analysis**: Tracks offline frequency and durations
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Automatically adjusts based on device conditions
- **Combined scoring**: Uses weighted scoring for more accurate predictions

### 2. Adaptive Caching Strategies

The system now adapts its caching strategy based on:

- **Battery level**: Reduces caching aggressiveness on low battery
- **Available storage**: Adjusts cache size based on available space
- **Network conditions**: Increases pre-caching on fast networks
- **Offline risk**: Prioritizes content likely to be needed during offline periods
- **Usage patterns**: Focuses on frequently used language pairs and contexts

### 3. Prioritized Pre-Caching

Content is now pre-cached with different priorities:

- **High priority**: Content with high offline risk or high combined score
- **Normal priority**: Regular content based on usage patterns
- **Multiple samples**: High priority content gets multiple sample texts
- **Realistic medical content**: More realistic and varied medical text samples

### 4. Device-Aware Operation

The system now monitors device conditions:

- **Battery monitoring**: Tracks battery level and adjusts accordingly
- **Storage monitoring**: Checks available storage space
- **Network speed monitoring**: Measures network performance
- **CPU/Memory usage**: Tracks resource usage to avoid overloading the device

## Configuration Options

The module can be configured through environment variables:

- `USAGE_LOG_FILE`: Path to the usage log file
- `PREDICTION_MODEL_FILE`: Path to the prediction model file
- `MAX_USAGE_LOG_SIZE`: Maximum number of entries in the usage log
- `PREDICTION_INTERVAL`: Interval for updating predictions (ms)
- `PRE_CACHE_LIMIT`: Maximum number of items to pre-cache
- `USAGE_PATTERN_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for identifying patterns
- `ENABLE_PREDICTIVE_CACHING`: Enable/disable predictive caching
- `TIME_WEIGHT`: Weight for time-based predictions
- `RECENCY_WEIGHT`: Weight for recency in predictions
- `FREQUENCY_WEIGHT`: Weight for frequency in predictions
- `BATTERY_THRESHOLD`: Battery percentage threshold for aggressive caching
- `OFFLINE_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD`: Hits required for offline priority

## Usage

The predictive cache module is automatically initialized when the Edge Application starts. It works in the background to:

1. Track usage patterns
2. Update the prediction model
3. Pre-cache predicted content
4. Adapt to changing conditions

No manual intervention is required, but you can monitor its operation through the logs.

## Implementation Details

### Prediction Model Structure

The prediction model includes:

```javascript
{
  languagePairs: {
    // Language pair data with usage statistics
  },
  contexts: {
    // Medical context data with time distributions
  },
  terms: {
    // Medical terminology data with associations
  },
  sequences: {
    // Sequential pattern data
  },
  timePatterns: {
    // Time-based usage patterns
    hourly: [...], // 24-hour distribution
    daily: [...],  // 7-day distribution
    hourlyLanguagePairs: {...},
    dailyLanguagePairs: {...}
  },
  userPatterns: {
    // User behavior patterns
    sessionDuration: 0,
    averageSessionItems: 0,
    commonSequences: [],
    contextTransitions: {}
  },
  networkPatterns: {
    // Network connectivity patterns
    offlineFrequency: 0,
    offlineDurations: [],
    averageOfflineDuration: 0,
    offlineTimeOfDay: [...]
  },
  adaptiveThresholds: {
    // Dynamic thresholds that adapt to conditions
    cacheAggressiveness: 0.5,
    priorityThreshold: 5,
    timeWeight: 0.3,
    recencyWeight: 0.4,
    frequencyWeight: 0.3
  },
  predictionSuccess: {
    // Tracks success rates of different prediction types
  },
  lastUpdated: 0
}
```

### Prediction Types

The system generates several types of predictions:

1. **Time-based predictions**: What's commonly used at this time of day/week
2. **Context-based predictions**: Based on current usage context
3. **Session-based predictions**: Based on common sequences in user sessions
4. **Term-based predictions**: Based on medical terminology
5. **Network-based predictions**: Based on offline patterns
6. **High-score predictions**: Based on combined scoring

### Sample Text Generation

The system generates realistic medical text samples for pre-caching, with:

- Context-specific templates
- Rich medical terminology
- Variation to ensure diverse cache
- Term incorporation for specific predictions

## Performance Considerations

- The prediction model is updated periodically, not on every request
- Pre-caching is throttled to avoid overwhelming the system
- Battery and storage constraints are respected
- Network usage is optimized based on connection quality
- Cache size is managed to prevent excessive storage use

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Machine learning-based prediction refinement
- User feedback incorporation
- Cross-device pattern synchronization
- Personalized prediction models
- Integration with scheduled appointments for context-aware pre-caching

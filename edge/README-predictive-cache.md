# Predictive Caching System for MedTranslate AI

The Predictive Caching System is an advanced feature of the MedTranslate AI Edge Application that enhances offline capabilities by predicting which content will be needed in the future and pre-caching it. This document provides an overview of the system, its features, and how to use it.

## Overview

The Predictive Caching System analyzes usage patterns, network conditions, and device state to intelligently cache content that is likely to be needed during offline periods. It includes the following key features:

- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Tracks translation usage patterns to identify frequently used language pairs, contexts, and content types.
- **Offline Risk Assessment**: Monitors network conditions to predict when the device might go offline.
- **Energy-Aware Caching**: Adjusts caching aggressiveness based on device battery level and charging status.
- **Cache Prioritization**: Prioritizes content based on importance and likelihood of use.
- **Offline Preparation**: Proactively prepares for offline periods by pre-caching predicted content.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for interacting with the Predictive Caching System:

### REST API

- `GET /cache/stats`: Get cache statistics and offline readiness information
- `POST /cache/prepare-offline`: Prepare for offline mode by pre-caching predicted content

### WebSocket API

- `get_cache_stats`: Get cache statistics and offline readiness information
- `prepare_offline`: Prepare for offline mode by pre-caching predicted content

## Usage

### Getting Cache Statistics

To get cache statistics and offline readiness information:

```javascript
// REST API
const response = await fetch('http://edge-device:3000/cache/stats');
const data = await response.json();
console.log('Cache stats:', data.stats);
console.log('Offline readiness:', data.offlineReadiness + '%');
console.log('Offline risk:', data.offlineRisk * 100 + '%');

// WebSocket API
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'get_cache_stats',
  requestId: 'cache-stats-request-id'
}));

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (response.type === 'cache_stats' && response.requestId === 'cache-stats-request-id') {
    console.log('Cache stats:', response.stats);
    console.log('Offline readiness:', response.offlineReadiness + '%');
    console.log('Offline risk:', response.offlineRisk * 100 + '%');
  }
};
```

### Preparing for Offline Mode

To prepare for offline mode by pre-caching predicted content:

```javascript
// REST API
const response = await fetch('http://edge-device:3000/cache/prepare-offline', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    forcePrepare: true,
    offlineRisk: 0.8,
    energyAware: true
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log('Offline preparation result:', data);

// WebSocket API
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'prepare_offline',
  requestId: 'prepare-offline-request-id',
  options: {
    forcePrepare: true,
    offlineRisk: 0.8,
    energyAware: true
  }
}));

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const response = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (response.type === 'prepare_offline' && response.requestId === 'prepare-offline-request-id') {
    console.log('Offline preparation result:', response);
  }
};
```

## Testing and Benchmarking

The Predictive Caching System includes comprehensive testing and benchmarking tools to evaluate its performance.

### Running Integration Tests

To run the integration tests for the Predictive Caching System:

```bash
cd edge
npm run test:predictive-cache
```

### Running Performance Benchmarks

To run the performance benchmarks for the Predictive Caching System:

```bash
cd edge
npm run benchmark:cache
```

The benchmarks measure the following aspects of the system:

- **Offline Preparation Performance**: How quickly and effectively the system can prepare for offline periods.
- **Prediction Generation Performance**: How efficiently the system can generate predictions.
- **Offline Translation Performance**: How well the system performs translations in offline mode.

## UI Components

The Predictive Caching System includes UI components for displaying cache status and offline readiness:

- **CachingStatusIndicator**: Displays cache health, offline readiness, and detailed cache statistics.
- **EnhancedOfflineIndicator**: Shows offline status with readiness information, offline risk assessment, and recommendations.

These components can be integrated into the frontend applications to provide users with visibility into the system's status.

## Configuration

The Predictive Caching System can be configured through the following environment variables:

- `CACHE_LIMIT`: Maximum number of items to cache (default: 1000)
- `CACHE_TTL`: Time-to-live for cached items in seconds (default: 86400)
- `OFFLINE_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD`: Threshold for prioritizing content for offline use (default: 5)
- `PREDICTION_MODEL_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: Interval for updating the prediction model in seconds (default: 3600)
- `ENERGY_CONSERVATION_THRESHOLD`: Battery level threshold for energy conservation (default: 0.3)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Predictive Caching System, try the following:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify that the edge application is running
3. Check network connectivity
4. Clear the cache and try again
5. Restart the edge application

If problems persist, please file an issue with detailed information about the problem.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Predictive Caching System include:

- **Advanced ML Models**: Integration of more sophisticated machine learning models for prediction.
- **Federated Learning**: Implementation of federated learning for privacy-preserving model training.
- **Adaptive Caching**: More advanced adaptive caching based on user behavior and device conditions.
- **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Synchronization of cache state across multiple edge devices.
- **Predictive Download**: Proactive downloading of content based on calendar events and scheduled appointments.

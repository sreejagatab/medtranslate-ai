# Enhanced System Monitoring Components for MedTranslate AI

This document provides an overview of the enhanced system monitoring components for the MedTranslate AI application. These components provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization of system status, including network quality, cache health, offline readiness, ML model performance, and more.

## Components Overview

### EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator

The `EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator` component provides a comprehensive view of network status, combining network quality metrics with caching status and offline readiness information. It offers real-time monitoring and detailed analytics for system health.

**Features:**
- Real-time network quality monitoring
- Visual indicators for network status
- Detailed network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput)
- Offline risk assessment
- Integration with WebSocket for real-time updates
- Animated indicators for critical status changes

**Usage:**
```jsx
import EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator from '../components/EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator';

// In your component
<EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator
  style={customStyles}
  webSocketService={webSocketService}
  cacheStats={cacheStats}
  offlineReadiness={offlineReadiness}
  offlineRisk={offlineRisk}
  onManualSync={handleManualSync}
  onPrepareOffline={handlePrepareOffline}
/>
```

### EnhancedSystemStatusDashboard

The `EnhancedSystemStatusDashboard` component provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring system status, including network quality, cache health, offline readiness, ML model performance, and more. It offers real-time updates and detailed analytics.

**Features:**
- System overview with key metrics
- Detailed sections for network, cache, ML models, and sync status
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Quick actions for common tasks (sync, prepare offline, refresh cache)
- System alerts for critical issues
- Visual indicators for system health

**Usage:**
```jsx
import EnhancedSystemStatusDashboard from '../components/EnhancedSystemStatusDashboard';

// In your component
<EnhancedSystemStatusDashboard style={customStyles} />
```

## Integration with Existing Components

These enhanced components integrate with existing components and services:

- **CachingStatusIndicator**: Provides detailed cache statistics and controls
- **useSystemStatus Hook**: Centralizes system status data and control functions
- **WebSocket Service**: Provides real-time updates for system status
- **Network Quality Service**: Monitors network quality and provides metrics

## Data Flow

1. The `useSystemStatus` hook fetches and maintains system status data from backend APIs
2. The hook provides this data to the dashboard and indicator components
3. Components visualize the data and provide user controls
4. User actions (e.g., manual sync) are handled by the hook's control functions
5. Real-time updates are received via WebSocket and reflected in the UI

## Customization

Both components accept a `style` prop for customizing their appearance:

```jsx
const customStyles = {
  container: {
    margin: 10,
  },
  indicator: {
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#333333',
  }
};

<EnhancedNetworkStatusIndicator style={customStyles} />
```

## Offline Support

These components are designed to work in offline mode:

- They display the current offline status and readiness
- They provide controls for preparing for offline mode
- They show cached data when offline
- They queue actions for when connectivity is restored

## Performance Considerations

- The dashboard uses lazy loading for detailed sections
- Network quality measurements are performed on-demand to conserve resources
- Animations are optimized for performance
- Real-time updates are throttled to prevent excessive rendering

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles and labels
- Color schemes provide sufficient contrast
- Status changes are announced to screen readers
- All functionality is accessible via keyboard

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for these components include:

1. More detailed ML model performance visualizations
2. Enhanced predictive analytics for offline risk
3. Integration with device-specific metrics (battery, CPU, memory)
4. User-configurable dashboard layouts
5. Export functionality for system status reports

## Related Components

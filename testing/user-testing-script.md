# MedTranslate AI: User Testing Script

## Introduction (5 minutes)

Hello and thank you for participating in this user testing session for MedTranslate AI. My name is [Facilitator Name], and I'll be guiding you through this session today.

### Purpose
We're testing a medical translation application designed to help healthcare providers communicate with patients who speak different languages. The application includes both a provider interface and a patient interface.

### Session Format
- This session will last approximately 60 minutes
- I'll ask you to complete specific tasks using the application
- Please think aloud as you work through each task
- There are no right or wrong ways to complete these tasks
- We're testing the application, not you
- Your feedback will help us improve the application

### Recording Notice
With your permission, we'll record this session for internal review purposes only. The recording will only be shared with the development team.

Do you have any questions before we begin?

## Background Questions (5 minutes)

1. What is your role in healthcare?
2. How often do you interact with patients who speak a different language?
3. What methods do you currently use to communicate with these patients?
4. Have you used any translation technology in a healthcare setting before?
5. What devices do you typically use during patient interactions?

## Provider Dashboard Testing (20 minutes)

I'll now ask you to complete several tasks using the Provider Dashboard. Please remember to think aloud as you work.

### Task 1: Create a New Translation Session
- Navigate to the Provider Dashboard
- Create a new translation session
- Set the patient language to Spanish
- Set the medical context to "General Consultation"

### Task 2: Filter Sessions by Date Range
- Navigate to the Session Management Panel
- Filter sessions to show only those from the past week
- Sort the filtered sessions by patient name

### Task 3: Export a Session Transcript
- Select a completed session
- Export the transcript as a PDF
- Include both session metadata and summary in the export

### Task 4: Monitor Translation Quality
- Open the Translation Monitor Panel
- View the detailed statistics for translations
- Check the quality trend chart
- Report an error for a specific translation

## Patient Application Testing (20 minutes)

Now I'll ask you to switch roles and use the Patient Application as if you were a patient.

### Task 1: Select a Language
- Navigate to the language selection screen
- Try the auto-detect feature
- Manually select a language from the list
- Search for a specific language

### Task 2: Record a Voice Message
- Navigate to the recording screen
- Record a short message: "I have a headache and fever"
- Observe the visual feedback during recording
- Submit the recording for translation

### Task 3: Use Text Input Alternative
- Instead of recording, use the text input option
- Type a message: "I am allergic to penicillin"
- Submit the text for translation

### Task 4: Review Translation Results
- Review the translation of your message
- Check the confidence indicator
- Try requesting an alternative translation

## Follow-up Questions (10 minutes)

1. On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to use the Provider Dashboard?
2. On a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to use the Patient Application?
3. What features did you find most useful?
4. What features were confusing or difficult to use?
5. What features would you like to see added?
6. Would you use this application in your daily work? Why or why not?
7. How does this compare to your current methods of communicating with patients who speak different languages?

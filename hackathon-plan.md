# MedTranslate AI: Breaking Healthcare Language Barriers with AWS Generative AI and Edge Computing

## Project Overview

MedTranslate AI is a real-time medical translation and interpretation system that combines AWS generative AI services with edge computing and 5G connectivity to solve critical communication challenges in healthcare settings. The system enables seamless, accurate translation between healthcare providers and patients who speak different languages, including support for medical terminology, regional dialects, and cultural context.

## Problem Statement

Language barriers in healthcare settings lead to:
- Misdiagnosis and treatment errors
- Patient anxiety and frustration
- Longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates
- Inefficient use of medical staff time
- Reliance on family members or untrained staff for translation
- Limited access to quality healthcare for non-native language speakers

The problem is especially acute in emergency situations, rural areas, and for immigrant or refugee populations. Existing solutions like phone interpreters or video remote interpreting are costly, not always available, and introduce delays in care.
